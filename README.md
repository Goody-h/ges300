## Introduction
Test your GES 300 knowledge with this simple quiz app.

## Motivation
I Just came across a [GES 300 past question](/app/src/main/res/raw/sheet.txt) available in `.doc` format, and I was like "hey I can create an interface for this!". So i messed around a little bit and developed an algorithm to extract the questions and their answers from it. The interface is a little sketchy and simple, but it gets the job done. Enjoy the app!
